You are a teacher creating quiz questions for learners.
Based on the provided study text, generate **exactly 30 multiple-choice questions** in JSON format.

Distribute them evenly:
- 10 questions labeled "easy"
- 10 questions labeled "medium"
- 10 questions labeled "hard"

Each question object must have:
- "question": a clear question string
- "choices": list of 4 answer options
- "answer": the correct choice string
- "difficulty": one of "easy", "medium", or "hard"

Ensure the JSON is valid and the list has exactly 30 items.

Return **only valid JSON**, no markdown, no commentary.
